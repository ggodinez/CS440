The data you are using is the SUSANNE corpus, compiled by Gregory Sampson et
al., which is in turn an annotated version of parts of the Brown corpus.  The
primary advantage of this over the Wall Street Journal corpus I discussed in
class is that it is available for free download.  The Susanne corpus comes with
a number of annotations, including part-of-speech.  The tagset of the corpus is
quite complex, with several hundred categories.  The tagset is hierarchical,
however, and so I have chosen to collapse it to its highest categories to make
analyzing your data more straightforward.  In general I did this collapse by
removing all but the first letter of the original tag; I have also combined a
few categories together where I thought it would make more sense to you.

This is the tagset in the data for this assignment.
C = conjunction
D = determiner (also includes original A tags)
E = existential there (as in "there is a fly in my soup")
F = non-words (suffixes, prefixes, acronyms, zipcodes, foreign word, ...)
G = 's when used to indicate possession (as in "Dr. Breck's office is 419")
I = preposition (also includes original B tags)
J = adjective
L = "pre-coordinator" (look in the data for examples)
M = numeral
N = noun
P = pronoun
R = adverb
T = the word 'to' when used to introduce an infinitive verb
U = interjection
V = verb
X = the word 'not' (most uses)
Y = punctuation mark
Z = letter of the alphabet
<s> = a special word and tag indicating the end of a sentence.
