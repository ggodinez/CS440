Homework 3 - "Wumpus World" 
Implemented a logical agent that uses a knowledge base to explore a cave world that has a "Wumpus" (monster), pits, and gold. 
The Wumpus emits a smell when in proximity to the player and players feel a breeze when a pit is nearby. 
The implemented agent works by representing knowledge about the cave world in a knowledge base and 
alternates exploring new spaces and updating the knowledge base based on if a smell or breeze is observed. 
The agent then chooses a to move to a new location based on the updated knowledge base.

Homework 5 - Hidden Markov Model (Part-of-speech tagging) 
Implemented the Viterbi algorithm to build a part-of-speech tagging system on a given corpus.
